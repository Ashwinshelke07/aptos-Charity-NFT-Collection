# Charity NFT Collection

## Overview

**Charity NFT Collection** is a blockchain-based project built using the Aptos Move language.
It enables people to **mint NFT art collections** in exchange for donations, with all raised funds going directly to a designated charity wallet.
The process is transparent, verifiable, and free from intermediaries.

## Project Goal

**Mint NFT art collections for charity funding** — Donors receive unique NFTs as proof of their contribution, while charities get instant, secure, and borderless funding.

## Vision

To build a **transparent and decentralized charity ecosystem** where:

* Donors can clearly see how their contributions are used.
* Charities can raise global funds without high transaction fees or delays.
* NFTs become **digital certificates of impact**, encouraging more community participation.

## Future Scope

* **Actual NFT Minting** — Implement on-chain NFT creation with metadata, replacing the placeholder counter.
* **Support Multiple Charities** — One contract to handle donations to various charities.
* **Donation Leaderboards** — Recognize and reward top donors with special edition NFTs.
* **Cross-Chain Donations** — Accept multiple cryptocurrencies and cross-chain transfers.
* **Charity Verification** — On-chain verification of registered charities for enhanced trust.

Do you want me to also add **example commands** showing how to deploy and interact with this contract on Aptos? That would make the README more practical.
